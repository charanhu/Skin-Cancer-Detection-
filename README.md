In this kernel I have followed following 14 steps for model building and evaluation which are as follows :
#Step 1 : Importing Essential Libraries
#Step 2: Making Dictionary of images and labels
#Step 3: Reading and Processing Data
#Step 4: Data Cleaning
#Step 5: Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
#Step 6: Loading & Resizing of images
#Step 7: Train Test Split
#Step 8: Normalization
#Step 9: Label Encoding
#Step 10: Train validation split
#Step 11: Model Building (CNN)
#Step 12: Setting Optimizer & Annealing
#Step 13: Fitting the model
#Step 14: Model Evaluation
